# Data available in this repo

* California housing. I downloaded from http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html  with a direct link of http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.tgz then merged the two files, one of which was data and one of which was the headers. I put the headers into the data file and called it CaliforniaHousing.csv.
